# Overview

This is a web app that displays data from MongoDB. I have never used MongoDB, React, or Express before. These were three new technologies that I wanted to learn, so I made a simple app that displays data from Mongo. The biggest thing I learned from this was how all of the technologies interacted with one another. This was my goal from the beginning. It's nice to learn one technology, but learning several at once and diving right into the deep end helped me to get a crash course in their functionality and now I'm a lot more confident in making something more ambitious the next time I trry.

# Web Pages

There is only one web page. The web app is dynamically updated every time the database is. It's essentially a visual representation of the current state of the database.

# Development Environment

I used the MERN web stack. This stands for:
MongoDB - Database
ExpressJS - Server
React - Client
Node - Server
